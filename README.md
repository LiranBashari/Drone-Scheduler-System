The system includes database management, RESTful API development, a mission firing mechanism, and scheduling logic to manage drones and their missions effectively.

## Features
**Database Management:** Uses MongoDB for storing drone and mission data.
**RESTful API Development:** Provides API endpoints for managing drones, missions, and scheduling logic.
**Mission Firing Mechanism:** Implements a mechanism for firing missions to drones based on scheduling logic.
**Scheduling Logic:** Includes logic for scheduling missions based on drone availability and mission priorities.

## Technologies Used
**Python:** Programming language used for backend development.
**FastAPI:** Web framework used for developing the RESTful API.
**MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing drone and mission data.
**Pydantic:** Used for request and response validation in the API.
